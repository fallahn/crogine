    \brief Particle system.
    Updates and renders all particle emitters in the scene.
    Particle systems are renderable, but do write to the depth buffer.
    They do, however, read from the depth buffer, and so should be
    added to a Scene after any other render systems such as the
    ModelRenderer. This allows for correct blending of alpha transparent
    particle systems.
