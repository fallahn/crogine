    Custom flags can be created for any renderable component starting
    at (1<<0) and incrementing (1<<x) up to the minimum value (1<<62)

    Flags can be OR'd together so that only specific sets of geometry
    are rendered, if they match the Camera's current flags:

    \begincode
    camera.setRenderFlags(cro::Camera::Pass::Final, (Flags::Minimap | Flags::Skybox));

    While these flags are active only geometry with the Minimap or
    Skybox flags will be rendered by the camera.

        \brief Contains the View, ViewProjection and draw list for a given render pass.

        Cameras are updated for multiple passes for (optionally) rendering reflections
        and refraction maps which can be used for flat planes in a Scene such as water.

        The matrices for each pass are updated by the camera system, and the draw lists
        are updated by any Renderable system. It is up to the user to implement this in
        any custom renderable systems.

        When rendering passes for reflection or refraction mapping the active pass has to
        be selected on the Camera first, before then rendering the Scene

        \begincode
        camera.setActivePass(Camera::Pass::Reflection);
        camera.reflectionBuffer.clear();
        scene.draw(camera.reflectionBuffer);
        camera.reflectionBuffer.display();

        camera.refractionBuffer.display();

        camera.setActivePass(Camera::Pass::Final);
        scene.draw(renderWindow);
        \endcode

        As each pass is rendered the RenderFlags for that specific pass is used to filter
        any drawables.

        Note that if any post process effects are active on the Scene that they should be
        disabled by first calling scene.setPostEnabled(false) and then re-enabling
        them for the final pass, to prevent post processes getting rendered into the
        reflection/refraction map buffers.
        Multiple passes can be combined with Camera::renderFlags to ensure specific
        sets of geometry are rendered during different passes.
