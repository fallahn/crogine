    \brief System wide message bus for custom event messaging

    The app class contains an instance of the MessageBus which allows
    events and messages to be broadcast system wide, upon which objects
    entities and components can decide whether or not to act. Custom
    message type IDs can be added by extending the ID set starting
    at Message::Type::Count. EG

    enum MyMessageTypes
    {
    AlienEvent = Message::Type::Count,
    GhostEvent,
    BadgerEvent //etc...
    };

        \brief Places a message on the message stack, and returns a pointer to the data

        The message data can then be filled in via the pointer. Custom message types can
        be defined via structs, which are then created on the message bus. Structs should
        contain only trivial data such as PODs and pointers to other objects.
        ATTEMPING TO PLACE LARGE OBJECTS DIRECTLY ON THE MESSAGE BUS IS ASKING FOR TROUBLE
        Custom message types should have a unique 32 bit integer ID which can be used
        to identify the message type when reading messages. Message data has a maximum
        size of 128 bytes.
        \param id Unique ID for this message type
        \returns Pointer to an empty message of given type.
