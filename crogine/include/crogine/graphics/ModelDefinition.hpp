    \brief Contains all the resource IDs
    required for a specific model.
    These may be populated by loading from a path
    to a valid ConfigFile. The information can then
    be used to load data into a model component at run time.
    This is useful for loading model data from disk once and
    then creating multiple instances of it:
    \begincode
    ModelDefinition definition(resources);
    if(definition.loadFromFile("assets/models/crate.cmt"))
    {
        //create the first model
        auto entity = scene.createEntity();
        entity.addComponent<Transform>().setPosition({100.f, 0.f, 100.f}):
        definition.createModel(entity);

        //create a second model
        entity = scene.createEntity();
        entity.addComponent<Transform>().setPosition({40.f, 0.f, -30.f});
        definition.createModel(entity);
    }
    \endcode

    If the model is going to be renderer with a DeferredRenderSystem then
    specify the need for deferred shaders when loading:
    \begincode
    definition.loadFromFile(path, true);
    \endcode

    If the model is NOT rendered with the deferred render system, but uses
    PBR materials then a pointer to the active Environment map must be
    passed to the ModelDefinition on construction:
    \begincode
    ModelDefinition definition(resource, &environmentMap);
    \endcode

    Note that models without PBR materials are unaffected and will
    load correctly whether the EnvironmentMap pointer is passed or not
