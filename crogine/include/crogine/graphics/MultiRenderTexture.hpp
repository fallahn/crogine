    \brief A render buffer with 1 or more colour targets and a depth buffer.
    MultiRenderTextures (or MRTs) have multiple colour targets and can be used
    as a G-Buffer for techniques such as deferred rendering or screen-space
    post processes like SSAO or depth of field. Unlike the standard RenderTexture
    the colour buffers are 32 bit floating point format for higher precision
    when rendering data such as normal or vertex position information, EXCEPT
    for attachment 0 which is a regular 8bit colour buffer, unless the floatingPoint
    parameter is set to true on creation, in which case it's a 16bit floating point texture.
    MultiRenderTextures are not available on mobile platforms, and RenderTexture
    should be used instead.

        it as the current target. All drawing operations will then be performed on it
        until display() is called. Both clear AND display() *must* be called either side of
